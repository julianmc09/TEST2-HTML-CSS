## Project description
This project is based on an HTML and CSS challenge in which you have to recreate a page and add animations to make it look attractive.
For animations, both keyframes and tags such as transition and transform will be used, which help bring buttons and links to life with interaction.

Now, beyond the aesthetic details, this project also features media queries that help the page adapt correctly to different devices, in this case the following resolutions:

Mobile: <= 480px
Tablet: >= 768px
Desktop: >= 1024px
